An agent-based simulation created in the context of a term paper by Friedrich Kreuser and Luzius Meisser for the lecture Computational Economics and Finance by Prof. Karl Schmedders at University of Zurich.

The simulation is kept as simple as possible. It contains two types of agents: citizens and firms. Firms either produce water or bread, which they sell on a market. They also offer jobs to the citizens, offering a salary. Citizens work at the firms, earning a salary and spending it on good. Well-fed citizens procreate after a configurable number of days ("pregnancy"). They are potentially immortal, but can die from hunger.

For details, read the code. Already after a few dozen rounds, equilibrium prices are found and the population stabilizes with ongoing minor fluctuations.
